# React + Vite

This is a front end mentor coding challange that is being developed using vite and the tech stack that is used is react js and tailwind css.

# State Management

The state mangement is done using simple useState hook and also this small application has a lot of prop drilling due to the fact that I am learning react and a beginner developer so I wanted to experience it and not use context api or other state management tools.

# The app has the following list of features:

- displays a list of all the available jobs.
- users can find a job that is suitable for them.
- users can add filters.
- users can remove a single item from the filters.
- users can clear all the filters in one go.
